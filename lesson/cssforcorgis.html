    <h2>About Welsh Corgis: </h2>
    <p>
        The Welsh or <a href="https://www.google.com">Corgi</a>, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically
        consistent
        "Corgwn"
        is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales.

        Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical
        differences between the two different breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger,
        both in weight and in height. Their tails are of different shapes; docking had previously been used.

        Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the
        10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common
        ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.

        The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on The Kennel Club's Vulnerable dog breeds of the
        United Kingdom list. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because the Queen has personally owned
        more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical agricultural counties in South West Wales. Welsh
        Corgis were cattle herding dogs the type of herding dog referred to as "heelers", meaning that they would nip
        at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. The combination of their low height off the
        ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term "Corgi"
        means either cur dog or dwarf dog (cor = dwarf, gi = lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not
        intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. Different tales have been
        told of the Corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while
        others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century.
        Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central
        European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were
        imported to Wales, they could have been either Deutsche Bracken, or Dachshund.

        The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has been attributed to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of
        similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some
        historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. In the late 19th century, farmers in began to
        switch from cattle to sheep but the corgi is not suited for working sheep. Similarities between the Welsh Corgis
        have been attributed to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from those who wished to
        have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke.

    <h3>United States</h3>
    <p>
        In 1933 the first Welsh Corgis were brought to the United States by American breeder Mrs. Lewis Roesler, for her
        Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had previously been well known for breeding Old
        English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke corgi, Little Madam, at London's Paddington Station for £12.
        Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The
        American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the
        first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr. E.M. Tidd in
        Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada. [17]

        Tidd imported Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding lines in 1935, registering him with the AKC as Sierra Bowhit
        Pivot. In addition to his British titles, he became the first Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and
        the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those
        achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories.[clarification needed] The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was
        formed in 1937,[17] and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge's Giralda Farms in New Jersey.
        Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which
        dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open
        conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed
        of dog in the United States. [26]

        A pair of Cardigan Welsh Corgis were imported to the US in 1931, but the first member of that breed to be
        registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the United States
        given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 Cardigan Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC,
        compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes. [26]

    <h2>Modern Breeds</h2>
    <p>
        There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it
        originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water resistant and shed on
        average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than that of the Pembroke; both breeds have
        short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground.[11][12] But they are not as square in outline as a typical
        Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund.[27] There are only minor differences in the
        shape of the head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an
        equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose.[1] It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a
        Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.[27]

        Corgis in the modern era often compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and
        herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Cardigan
        and Pembroke Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials – known
        colloquially as a "mad run".[28] Welsh Corgis were once used to guard children.[13]
